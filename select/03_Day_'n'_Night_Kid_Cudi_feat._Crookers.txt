Jones!

We Born to die (For Real)
So I get high, just like I'm gonna fly (to the moon)
I'm in the court with marijuana eyes (Sorry Judge)
We high the clubs into the morning rise (Cause of last night)
Cause day and night (day and night)
We run the streets so hope i don't pay that price (pray for me)
They got the nerve to tell me to press my breaks (what?)
And If i do then how will rent get paid? (eh, tell me)
So now I'm thinking that(whats your thoughts)
200 stacks what would bring me back?(you thinking a flip?)
Especially now that recessions here(its hard out here)
My only answer to my question is.is(you figure it out)
Okay now here's a thought (one more thought)
Streets are a marriage that you cannot devise (Ill)
Life is a bitch, but i think i fell in love (I love that bitch)
So i treat the game like I'm selling drugs (drugs - block is locked)

(Verse 1)
Day n nite. I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind.
I look for peace, but see I don't attain.
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play.
Now look at this.
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me.
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast.
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last.

(Chorus)
'Cause day n nite,
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone through the day n nite.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite.
Day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite

(Verse 2)
Hold the phone.

The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo.
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shake.
Within his dreams he sees the life he made.
Made.
The pain is deep.
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep.
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
It seems the feelings that she had are through.
Through.

(Chorus)
Cause day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone through the day n nite.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite.
Day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite

(Bridge)
Slow mo.
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new.
He seems alive, though he is feeling blue.
The sun is shining man he's super cool.
Cool.
The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nike's.
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way,
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...

(Chorus)
Day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone through the day n nite.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, ah ah at nite.
Day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night.
