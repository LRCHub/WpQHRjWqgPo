Day n Nite.
I toss n turn,
I keep stressin' my mind, mind.
I look for peace, but see I don't attain.
What I need for keeps this silly game,
We play, play.

Now look at this.
Madness the magnet
Keeps attracting me, me.
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast.
I think the first but surely finish last, last.

Cause day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone through the day n nite.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite.

Day n Nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite.

Hold the phone.
The lonely stoner missed his solo doe low.
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shake.
Within the dreams he sees the life he made.
Made.

The pain is deep.
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep.
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
It seems the feelings she had are through.
Through.

Cause day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone through the day n nite.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite.

Slow mo.
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new.
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue.
The sun is shinin man he's super cool.
Cool.

The lonely nites,
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes.
He smokes a clip then he's on his way.
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...

Day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone through the day n nite.
They lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite,
Ah ah at nite.

Day n nite.
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite.
He's all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night,
Ah ah at night.
Night.

Ah ah at nite.
Nite.
